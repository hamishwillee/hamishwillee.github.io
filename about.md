As community manager for the [Nokia Developer global community website](http://developer.nokia.com/community/wiki/Wiki_Home) (and earlier with the Symbian Foundation) Hamish created a welcoming, supportive and effective developer community. He was responsible for community strategic planning, improving infrastructure and processes, enabling easier technical contribution and collaboration, aligning community activities around Nokia's developer products and platforms, reporting on community health, advising internal teams on how to work better with the community, and demonstrating the value of the community investment within Nokia. 

Hamish has a particular passion for engaging developers to create outstanding technical articles. At Nokia he successfully led the effort to create the [Nokia Developer Windows Phone Wiki Portal](http://developer.nokia.com/community/wiki/Portal:Windows_Phone) - widely perceived as *one of the most useful community resources for Windows Phone developers*. He's polished thousands of technical articles to a high standard, and in previous roles even supported community members to write [books](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Symbian-Mobile-development-made/dp/1453747990). 
 
He lives in Melbourne, Australia with his family Jenny, Oscar, Sam, Leo and Fang.
